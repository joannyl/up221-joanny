## Profile
Hi, everyone! My name is Joanny and I’m a first-year MURP concentrating in TPP. I was born and raised in Gardena and went to UC Berkeley for undergrad. I’ve been working as a research analyst at an urban consulting firm downtown for the last two years and have mostly worked on projects related to environmental justice and sustainability. 

When I’m not in class/work I’m spending time with my mini dachshund, Soledad! :)

## Project Ideas
###### Idea 1: Measuring equity on Metro (or other MTA)
I’m not sure what might be the best way of going about it but I’m interested in measuring how equitable Metro is for riders. This may be using commute times for folks that live in different under-resourced census tracts or job access using public transportation.
###### Idea 2: Measure sustainability of Mexico City’s Metro system 
As the second largest Metro system in North America, Mexico City’s Metro system has had a huge cultural and structural impact on its low-income residents. A couple of sustainability measures include: 

*Environmental: CO2 intensity, land consumption

*Economic: fares, rider income 

*Social: quality of service, accessibility 

## Objectives
As someone who has zero experience with GIS and Python, my goal is to finish the course with a solid foundation in spatial data. I’d also really like to be able to apply what I learn at work. We help many organizations apply for grants like TCC/RCC and frequently provide support with their maps. I would love to be able to provide this service for organizations that have limited resources.
